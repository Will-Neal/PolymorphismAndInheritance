# PolymorphismAndInheritance

## Description

303.6.1 Practice Assignment - Polymorphism and Inheritance

Scenario: In our game app, we have many types of monsters that can attack. You will design a superclass called Monster and define the method of attack() in the superclass. You will design subclasses called FireMonster, WaterMonster, and StoneMonster. The subclasses will then provide their actual implementation. In the main program, we declare instances of the superclass, substitute them with the actual subclass, and invoke the method defined in the superclass.
